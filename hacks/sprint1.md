## Week 1:
Goals: 
- Setup Tools
- Meet Team
- Learn about learning experience design
- Change theme of the blogs and pages
- help create pong lesson

Problems:
- Most of my problems happened setting up kasm
    - Some of my scripts weren't up to date like the actiate.sh, so after talking with Mr. Mortensen I got the new ones from his updated repository.
    - My commits would keep breaking because 
- The theme of the pages was hard for me to change because I didn't know where to look. I needed to understand the repository structure better.


## Self Reflection

Overall, I spent a lot of time learning the enviornment. When trying to change the theme of the pages I learned about the structure of the repository. I think I still need to learn the system better so I can identify errors quicker.
